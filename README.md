# A-Comprehensive-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Water-Quality-Prediction-with-the-H2O-Framework

This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict water quality, focusing on classifying water as potable or non-potable. Using a comprehensive dataset, we pre-process and analyze data with Big Data tools such as Apache Spark and H2O. Our framework integrates ML and DL models to improve prediction accuracy, addressing challenges such as data imbalance and missing values. This research aims to improve the monitoring of water quality and environmental sustainability.

For our analysis we plan on using a dataset provided on Kaggle and can be accessed from here. This dataset represents different indicators including its nutrients, color, air and water temperature for measuring the water quality. All these variables are aligned with the date and time these indicators were getting measured. The dataset has 1,048,575 observations with 22 variables to be observed. Out of the 22 there are 3 categorical variables, while the rest are numeric. In addition to that, there is a target variable that identifies whether the water is potable or not.
